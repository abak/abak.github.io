## Experiences

### [Numscale](http://www.numscale.com) 
#### Freelance Software Engineer - January 2014 to Present

As a lead software engineer, I primarily work on the development of a sampling profiling solution based around the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel. This involves low-level programming as well as the definition of algorithm allowing a user to extract high-level performance indicators. Given my expertise of Image Processing and Computer Vision, I am also involved in short term projects requiring those skills.

*Keywords* : High Performance Computing - Parallel Computing - Systems - Profiling

*Skills* : C++, Boost, C, python, Linux system programming, project management

### [DxO Labs](http://www.dxo.com)
#### Image Processing R&D Engineer - July 2011 to Sept. 2013

As an Image Processing Engineer, I took part in the definition and implementation of image processing features  (tonemapping, denoising,.) of the raw converter software DxO Optics Pro. As a framework engineer, I took part in the design and the implementation of the API provided to GUI teams, as well as the overall performance optimization of the correction engine.

Most notably, I designed and implemented a new HDR rendering and tone-mapping method that was highlighted as one of the prominent features of DxO Optics Pro 8. This work involved an extensive R\&D phase, based on the image quality evaluation of the previous method and its limitations. I also worked with various other methods of the image processing pipeline, such as distortion correction, denoising or raw conversion.

I also improved the performance of various component, in order to provide Optics Pro users with the best possible results. This was done using SIMD instructions, or OpenCL, as well as reducing the memory footprint of specific algorithms.

### [Universite Paris-Sud XI](http://www.u-psud.fr/)
#### Image Processing PhD Student - Sept. 2008 to July 2011 (public defense 14 Oct 2011)

The main objective of this work was to design and implement new ways to establish a collaboration between stereo-vision and motion analysis, in order to improve road safety and intelligent vehicles autonomy. The primary axis of this work was to combine stereo-vision and points correspondences in order to measure the sensor's ego-motion. This ego-motion was finally compensated in order to detect independent motion. 

This was implemented as a complete, real-time system that was embedded in was of the  available test vehicles. The project was based on both proven components (through the OpenCV library) and original algorithm and made extensive use of modern parallel computing techniques such as SIMD and GPGPU (Cuda).

Finally, a fine study of imprecision sources was also conducted, which led to a set of recommandations, useful for every designer of intelligent and mobile vision system.

### [Stemmer Imaging](http://www.stemmer-imaging.fr/)
#### Field Application Engineer - Oct. 2007 to Sept.2008

As a Field Application Engineer, my first responsibility was to accompany industrial prospects and clients and help them design and implement a vision system meeting their requirements. I was involved in a wide variety of projects, ranging from industrial vision (quality control) to academic research (stereo vision) and to entertainment (real time motion capture)
