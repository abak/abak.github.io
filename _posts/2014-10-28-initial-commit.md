It feels a little empty here, so I guess, I will write something to explain why this space exists in the first place.

It basically serves several purposes. First, I wanted a writing exercise to improve my written communication skills. 
I also wanted some kind of a web-based notebook, where I could put down potential ideas, and, more importantly,to remember what I did on a particular project in case I forgot or switch to something else before completion.

Finally, I also wanted to venture into web development, both during my PhD, and later, as an engineer, I was mostly working with static, compiled language, and all the web goodness kinda looked like black magic.
