It feels a little empty here, so I guess, I will write something to explain why this space exists in the first place.

It basically serves several purposes. First, I wanted a writing exercise to improve my written communication skills. 
I also wanted some kind of a web-based notebook, where I could put down potential ideas, and, more importantly,to remember what I did on a particular project in case I forgot or switch to something else before completion.

Finally, I also wanted to venture into web development, both during my PhD, and later, as an engineer, I was mostly working on offline stuff whether [embedded in vehicles](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00138-011-0389-x), as [desktop applications](https://www.dxo.com/intl/photography/dxo-optics-pro/photo-software), or more recently on [high performance computing](http://www.numscale.com), so most of the web goodness kinda look like black magic, but I guess any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
