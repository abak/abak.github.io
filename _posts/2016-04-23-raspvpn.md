title: Raspberry Pi as a VPN wifi hotspot
---

This post is a notebook of the setup I use with one of my raspberry pi to get it running a wi-fi hotspot that routes all of its traffic through a VPN.

---

## Basic Setup : 

This setup uses a Raspberry Pi 3 model b, mostly because it has onboard Wi-Fi. I also conducted tests on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B with a Buffalo Wi-Fi dongle that supports the [`nl80211` driver](https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/documentation/nl80211).

The OS is an up-to-date Raspbian Jessie, which means that the init system is [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).

## Software Dependencies

The following needs to be installed : 

* openvpn : to connect to the vpn server
* hostapd : to create the wifi hotspot
* udhcpd : to give IP adresses to the devices connected to the hotspot

````
sudo apt-get install openvpn hostapd udhcpd
````
The package 'iptables-persistent` can also be installed to provide an easier way to persist iptables rules.


## Wi-Fi hotspot

To set up the rapsi as a Wi-Fi hotspot, we need to set up the ethernet and the wireless interfaces. Only the latter needs to be set up with a static IP (since it will be the dhcp server for that network), but for convenience, I set both as static.

````
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.11.42
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.11.1
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

auto wlan0
iface wlan 0 inet static 
        addres 192.168.42.1
        netmask 255.255.255.0

up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.nat.vpn.secure
````

The last line imports the iptable rules at startup. Those rules are here to perform NAT between the internet and the internal network, and to make sure that all traffic is routed through the vpn.
