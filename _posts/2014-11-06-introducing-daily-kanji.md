title: Introducing DailyKanji
---

I took some time to get a little web application together. You can see a [live version](https://dailykanji.herokuapp.com/) on the interweb, the source code is available over at [github](https://github.com/abak).

It's basically a nice little bundle of web buzzwords: the server-side is based on [Node.js](www.nodejs.org), the client-side relies on [jQuery](www.jquery.com) for all DOM manipulation, I used [bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com) for the styling and [PostgreSQL](www.postgresql.com) for storage. All of that is deployed via [Heroku](www.heroku.com).

All in all, I admire the web development community for putting together powerful tools that really speed-up development, and basically made it possible for me, with basically 0 webdev experience to go from a vague concept to a live web-application in under a week.
