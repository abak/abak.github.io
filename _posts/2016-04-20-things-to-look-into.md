title: Things I want to look into
---

This post will be a personal reminder of the things I want to look into in the near future for various reasons.

---

* [mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose), or the open source fork [civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb). In particular, I want to evaluate the cost this would have if it were used to monitor high performance applications.
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) looks like a cool language that can be used for demanding applications, while being relatively modern. I want to give it a try on some moderately sized project, to see how well it can be used for HPC.
* docker for CUDA applications looks like an ideal way to distribute CUDA applications without havinf to care about each and every individual setup and drivers.
* [conan.io](www.conan.io) C++ lacks a common and well integrated way to manage dependencies. This is a promissing project that aims at doing jsut that. It started as an open-source fork of [biicode](www.biicode.com), after the company that started it died. 
* Try to look into the most popular Deep Learning Framework, like [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), [Torch](http://torch.ch/), [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* I recently set up one of my Raspberry Pis as a wifi hotspot that routes all of its incoming traffic through an OpenVPN tunnel. I need to document this process so I can reproduce it if needed. I think that having a web GUI to switch servers could also be nice.
 
I guess this can keep me busy for the forseeable future.
