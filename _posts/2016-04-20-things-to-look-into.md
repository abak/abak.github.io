title: Things I want to look into
---

This post will be a personal reminder of the things I want to look into in the near future for various reasons.

---

* [mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose), or the open source fork [civetweb](https://github.com/civetweb/civetweb). In particular, I want to evaluate the cost this would have if it were used to monitor high performance applications.
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) looks like a cool language that can be used for demanding applications, while being relatively modern. I want to give it a try on some moderately sized project, to see how well it can be used for HPC.
* docker for CUDA applications looks like an ideal way to distribute CUDA applications without havinf to care about each and every individual setup and drivers.
* conan.io 
* write a blog post to remember how i set up my raspberry pi as a vpn enabled wifi hotspot
